Today was the first official day of the System Design Capstone. My intention with this journal is to document struggles, breakthroughs, and everything in-between. Each day I will cover the issues that arose, how I went about solving them (or what I am doing to attempt to solve them), and what I will take from the experience moving forward

## Thoughts:

Learning a new code base is always a bit tricky, but it's good to practice reading and familiarizing yourself with someone else's coding style and structure. I spent the majority of my time today just getting familiar with the new code base I inherited as part of the project. I will now be responsible for refactoring the back end structure of the Nav Bar/Cart component.

## Challenges faced:

Seeding database with a large amount of data

## Actions taken:

Create a loop that will instantiate batches of documents to be inserted in the database.

- I did this successfully with MongoDB using Mongo Atlas, but ran out of the free-tier's memory allowance after 3.3 million documents.
- Gathered more practice using async/await in a loop structure

## Results/Takeaways:

A hosted DB will not be the appropriate solution for the 10 million+ records that will be loaded for this project. Instead, I think the proper approach is to leverage a locally-spun up DB instance in the remote EC2 server and make use of the server's memory space rather than Atlas's.
