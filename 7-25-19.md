## Thoughts:

Today was dedicated to testing. I started out simply wanting to conduct unit tests on my server routes - nothing more, nothing less. It's very easy to find information on conducting integrated server/database tests that will test the information the client is to receive after hitting that particular route, but it is considerably more difficult to find good, informative documentation on testing server routes in isolation.

This is fundamentally more difficult to achieve because of the tendency of (or possibily the requirement of) tightly coupling database helper methods to the server route. In a typical (production) scenario, the following occurs:

1. a client makes an HTTP request with information from the user
2. the HTTP request hits the server at the appropriate route
3. the server executes a DB helper function and passes the information from the user
4. the database performs the appropriate action (CRUD)
5. the database sends a response back to the server to indicate that the action was successful (or not)
6. the server responds to the client with the appropriate status codes to indicate the result of the request

The problem with unit testing server routes comes primarily from number 3. The server-database tight coupling means that the server route cannot be hit without triggering the downstream database methods. Solving this problem took me nearly the entire day, but there is an interesting solution: mocks.

Through using a package called [rewire](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rewire) which is called in the same way as `require`, you are able to override imported files/functions. That way when my server executes `const db = require('./db')`, I can step in to intercept that import and use a different file instead.

This prevents a lot of otherwise required refactoring in the server or use of unncessary environment variables to conditionally import/execute under testing scenarios. Instead, the server can import the database and call its helper functions as they are written. Unbeknownst to it, however, the server is actually calling mock functions that simply return static data rather than querying a live database and testing more than I intend to test.

Here's how it all works (in my test file):

```
const rewire = require('rewire');
const app = rewire('../server/server.js');
const dbMock = require('./mocks/serverMocks');

app.__set__('db', dbMock);
```

What's happening here? When I import my server (called app), I'm using rewire instead of require. That allows me to call `app.__set__` which takes a variable name as a string as the first parameter and an overriding variable as the second paramter.

Here's what my server looks like:

```
const db = require('./database');
...
app.get('/api/cart/items', (req, res) => {
  db.cart
    .get()
    .then(items => res.status(200).send(items))
    .catch(err => res.status(400).send());
});
```

So when I use `app.__set__`, the `db` variable in the server no longer refers to `./database` - it refers to `./mocks/serverMocks`. That means that if I define and export a `cart.get()` method in serverMocks, I can confidently hit the `/api/cart/items` server route without having to fear pinging the database itself and without modifying any of the server's code. As long as my mock's `cart.get()` method returns the same data shape and type that my server expects (mimicking the database's response), then the server route should have no issues using the mock functions rather than the true database helpers. For example, because my `db.cart.get()` is chained to a `.then()` in the server, that means that my mock's get function must return a promise, not just the dummy query result itself.

## Challenges faced:

Test server routes in isolation - true unit tests on the server itself

## Actions taken:

- Use Supertest in conjunction with Rewire to monkey-patch the db helper methods with mock helpers that return static data

## Results/Takeaways:

Sometimes it is easier to write integration tests rather than unit tests, but there is still a lot of value in writing unit tests for server routes. TDD truly can be instrumental in writing clean, modular code because TDD often demands modularity in order to write testable code.
