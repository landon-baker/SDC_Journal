# SDC Journal

### Enclosed is a collection of thoughts, research, and new revelations as I journey through the System Design Capstone (SDC) project at Hack Reactor.

### The System Design Capstone is an efficiency-first project meant to mimic real world application scaling issues and practices in a system-oriented architecture framework. Using Front End Capstone projects written by other Hack Reactor classmates, we now face the challenge of seeding a database with 10 million+ records, comparing the read/write efficiency of SQL and No-SQL databases, and producing a performant microservice with optimal back end design.

### Enjoy!
